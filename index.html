<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--This is a doctype. Every HTML file should have one.
Basically you only need this one nowadays, as this means HTML5 (what you're learning here)
for modern browsers but old browsers still pick up that your file is some kind of HTML.-->
<html>
<!-- Here the HTML starts, so we put an opening <html> tag here. -->
  <head>
<!-- Inside the <head> we can put some meta information… -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Our Page Title</title>
<!-- … like charset and title. -->
  </head>
<!-- And we close our <head> element and open the <body>, where the actual content goes. -->
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- And in the end we close the <body> and <html> tag. -->
